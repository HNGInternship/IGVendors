# IGVendors
Project Description;
An eCommerce website that finds and displays Instagram vendors, these vendors are found by agents to be displayed to customers/visitors of the website. 
These customers/visitors are shown the products of these vendors and if the customer is interested in the product, the customer is then forwarded to the Instagram vendors page(which is instagram) where the transaction is completed. These vendors' products are inputted by agents who have a backend where they add vendors and also if a vendor wants to manage their account they can. They can also be able to change their name, description and contact info and product info. But they can only be added to the platform by agents. This is an international platform, not a local one.
Idea:
We are to find and host metadata of Vendors on Instagram
These vendors will be able to modify these metadata.
We are to properly format these metadata to be usable by Google SEO Standards.
Tags to group vendors.
Users can add new information about particular vendors that is then approved
People can leave reviews about the vendors
You can see the location of the vendors

- General user: To search, view and visit the vendors page on IG
- Registered User: Can leave reviews, suggests new information about vendors
- Vendors: May manage their own page on IG -Vendor
- Agents: Adds, Updates Vendors
- Super Admins: Creates Agents, Manage Vendors and Reviews


Features: 

- Homepage - Presenting search box and search results to users.
- A Backend to Manage Metadata And Vendors and their Products

Bottlenecks:



Requirements:

- Visibility study, how to we generate revenue, what is the start up cost, what is the running cost and all that.

Random Ideas [Anything is allowed]:

- Vendors can promote their products to get premium listing
- Email can be sent to customers with registered email address to update them about trending/new products in the categories they have shown interest in.
- One of the major problems of e-commerce in Nigeria is shipping. We can partner with a courier company to make it easier for the Vendors to ship to the Buyers. This will promote engagement with the site.
- The products or images on the vendors IG page are fetched with their IG handles(usernames)
- Details of aggregated vendors should be saved in a spreadsheet, this would help us have a unified schema to work with.
